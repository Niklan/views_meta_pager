# Meta pager for Views.

This module provide ability to activate metatags `rel="prev"` and `rel="next"`.

This metatags are [recommended by Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1663744).

By default, Metatags module provide ability to set those two tags via UI in advanced tags. But unfortunately is working only on one site from all those i tested. This is very unobvious token to do this `[site:current-page:url]?page=[current-page:page-number]`. I don't know how it works on site where is works, but this is 'magic', and i don't like it. So this module helps you to set this metatags for views pages, but be careful, don't forget leave empty this tags in Metatags.
